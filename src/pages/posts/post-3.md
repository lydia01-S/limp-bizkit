# Fred Durst shows off curly hair

For years, Fred Durst has been defined by his backwards red cap or, when he ditched it a famously bald head. Confusion sparked online when pictures started flooding the internet showing the nu-metal grandfather rocking a thick, fully grown head of hair—often, that seems to change in between concerts sometimes long and curly, sometimes white, sometimes dark. 
Fan's are confused after seeing pictures of Fred Durst's out grown hair... Confused as he's been bald for years. Has he gotten a hair transplant? Had the abilty to grow hair for years? Or is he hiding something? He refuses to comment on the issue, stating he's had this hair for years. When shown pictures of himself bald, he simply states "it's just the lighting" and to "leave him alone". It seems to be a sensitive issue for the Nu metal singer. 

Fred Durst has been embracing this new look during the Loserville tour, showing he's the grandfather of Nu metal. But it's only a matter off time til the wig falls off...
