# We missed you at Loserville.
## Maybe next time?


Limp Bizkit's "Loserville" Tour is proving that nu-metal's kings are still masters of chaos, delivering an electrifying surge of '90s and 2000s nostalgia mixed with their signature brand of high-octane fun. By popular demand Limp Bizkit is going back on tour to bring Loserville worldwide. 
Far from a retrospective sigh, this tour is a vibrant, aggressive party anchored by Fred Durst's commanding, self-aware swagger and Wes Borland's truly otherworldly, captivating visual artistry. As they blast through mosh-pit anthems like "Break Stuff" and "Rollin'," the energy is palpable, creating a unifying vortex for long-time fans and a new generation of red-cap-wearing attendees. With a diverse and often unconventional lineup of support acts, the "Loserville" tour embraces its namesake with tongue firmly in cheek, ultimately guaranteeing an unforgettable night of loud, proud, and unapologetic rock spectacle.
