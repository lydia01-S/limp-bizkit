# Fred Durst and Wes Borland are bringing style back

The Nu metal genre has often celebrated costumes on stage, but as the years go by the genre has diluted it's theatrical element. But the father's of Nu metal are bringing back the old school element to the genre. 

<br>
Fred Durst's 'Dad Vibes' persona has reached its pinnacle on the "Loserville" Tour, where he often trades rock star theatrics for self-aware, casual comfort—think soft cardigans, unassuming golf shirts, and occasionally even a robe, creating a strangely endearing and relatable contrast to the band's aggressive music. 

<br> Meanwhile, Wes Borland continues to be the undisputed master of stage spectacle, with his full-body paint, elaborate costumes, and custom masks ensuring he remains one of rock's most visually arresting figures. The sheer dichotomy between Durst's low-key, ironically domestic look and Borland's intensely complex, alien-like presentation is a crucial part of the Limp Bizkit live experience, turning their performance into a fascinating and unique visual event where ironic simplicity meets performance art excess.
